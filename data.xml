		<history>
			<header>History</header>
			<text>Hashcube, started its journey back in 2008, with a sudoku website and has grown to be one of the few studios in India building successful casual games on freemium model.

      When our co-founders started they just wanted to make games that are simple and fun to play. The ‘simplicity’ has always been the key ingredient of our games here at Hashcube. Our co-founders believed “Simple can be harder than complex”, and that approach has driven the team to make easy to play, fun games for our users.</text>
